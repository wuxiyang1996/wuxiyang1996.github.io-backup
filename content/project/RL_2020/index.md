FireCommander 2020 is a project that intends to derive an optimal heterogenous multi-agent team control method via inverse reinforcement learning. The multi-agent control is based on the massive user data collected through online interactive platform and optimized with inverse reinforcement learning method. My responsibility in this project covers:
 * Investigate the state-of-art of the reinforcement learning, learning from demonstration and multi-agent control, analyze the multi-agent control problem with the mathematical model like AEKF
 * Design the simulation environment for the multi-agent firefighting tasks with PyGame based on the real environment setting, fire propagation model, agent kinematics and control mode, established the user-interface with PyQt5, design the data storage and animation reconstruction method
 * Implement the reward function based on the relative importance of target, designed various scenarios to deal with real-world circumstances, set up the online platform for massive user data collection, processed the data acquired
 * Design and optimize the multi-agent firefighting control method based on the multi-agent learning from demonstration algorithm and user data collected

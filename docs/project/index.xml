      <title>Convex Optimization Approach for Car-Like Robot Trajectory Planning</title>
      <link>https://wuxiyang1996.github.io/project/convex_traj/</link>

      <guid>https://wuxiyang1996.github.io/project/convex_traj/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project utilizes convex optimization methods to optimize the car-like robots&#39; trajectories generated by sample-based methods. The overall algorithm follows a phased, iterative framework. The first step is to smooth the trajectory shape within the predefined convex searching domain with Elastic Band Stretching method, while the next step is to use MTSOS algorithm to optimize the velocity distribution over the trajectory with respect to the dynamic model. Appropriate modifications are also applied to further improve the optimization performance. My responsibility in this project covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulate robot trajectory planning as a convex optimization problem, establish three diverse experimental scenarios, generate the baseline trajectories with RRT, PRM and FMT under these scenarios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement the trajectory shape optimization with Elastic Band Sketching and CVX Toolbox, implemented velocity optimization with MTSOS, establis the optimization solver with MATLAB, incorporate the trajectory optimization model with artificial potential field for further optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify the algorithm performance under three scenarios, visualize and analyze the optimized trajectories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

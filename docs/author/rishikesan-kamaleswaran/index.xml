      <title>BARK-COVID: An XGBoost Model to Predict Hospitalization at time of COVID-19 Diagnosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project intends to develop a prediction model with machine learning methods for COVID-19 diagnosis. The model reads patients&#39; clinical history, bio-medical measurements and physical features and make binary classification that predicts 30-day hospital admission for COVID-19 patients. The baseline methods include ElasticNet, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression. The prediction is evaluated by several metrics based on the confusion matrix. The final prediction model achieves an accuracy over 80%. My responsibility in this project covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze and filter clinical history, bio-medical testing and physical features in raw datasets, impute missing values via iterativeimputer, establish 5 folder training and testing dataset for prediction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement several machine learning models, including ElasticNet, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression and XGBoost to predict 30-day hospital admission for COVID-19 patients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze and visualize prediction results generated by each model, compared the prediction with actual 30-day admission records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Translation Model from PPG to ABP</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project intends to develop the translation model that interprets non-invasive blood pressure measurement Photoplethysmography (PPG) into invasive measurement Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP). Several distinct approaches have been made to achieve this goal. The first approach uses generative model for time series translation, while another one extracts indirect measurements for PPG signal and investigate their co-relation with systolic and diastolic blood pressure extracted from ABP signal. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis is also made to achieve an overall image of all kinds of blood pressure measurements. My responsibility in this project covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigate the frontier of heart rate analysis and generative model for time series translation, pre-process Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) and Photoplethysmography (PPG) signal in MIMIC-II waveform dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement several benchmarks for the translation task, including TCN, LSTM and autoencoder, analyzed the mechanism for each benchmark and the temporal correlation within time series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract indirect measurement for blood pressure from PPG signal, like Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) and Slope Transit Time (STT), investigate their co-relation with corresponding systolic and diastolic blood pressure extracted from ABP signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis for synchronized heart rate signal ABP, PPG and ECG through PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

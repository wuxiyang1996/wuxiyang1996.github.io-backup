This article presents an online scratch detection method based on the four-source photometric stereo method. Considering the size of the component, the system divides the inspection process into several locations and generates the standard template covering the whole component beforehand. Once the component approaches one of the presupposed locations, lights from different directions turn on successively and the inspection system acquires images under dim lateral lights. After acquisition, the system compensates the images acquired for their spatial deviation, and coordinates them on the standard template. After coordination, the system extracts the inspection region in the coordinated images, generates the curvature image with the photometric stereo method and detects scratches in the curvature image. Two experiments are designed to verify the feasibility of the inspection method and evaluate the system\u0026rsquo;s performance in the online inspection environment.

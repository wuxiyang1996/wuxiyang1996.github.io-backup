Focusing on the coopeartive heterogenous MARL in FireCommander2020 environment, which is highly dynamic and stochastic, this project intends to investigate and propose a multi-agent communication learning framework to improve the cooperative behavior in collaborative Markov games and existing MARL algorithms. This project is still ongoing and expected to be done at the end of November. My responsibilities in this project covers:
 * Investigate the state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, analyze the characteristics for several popular MARL algorithm, formulate the multi-agent joint perception-control task in FireCommander environment as a POMDP problem
 * Regulate the FireCommander2020 environment for the multi-agent reinforcement learning, incorporate the agent and fire state update, reward computation module within the framework
 * Implement several MARL algorithms IDQN, DIAL, CommNet, QMIX, COMA, etc. on the FireCommander environment to learn the coordination and cooperation in the heterogeneous agent team
 * Implementing the novel experience sharing method for the optimal coordination and cooperation on the FireCommander environment and compare its performance with the benchmark algorithms

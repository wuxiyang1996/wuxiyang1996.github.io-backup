I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Maryland. My research interests mainly covers reinforcement learning, machine learning and optimization.

Previously, I recevied my M.S. Degree from Georgia Institute of Technology and B.Eng. Degree from Tianjin Universtiy. I used to be a research assistant on multi-agent reinforcement learning supervised by Dr. Matthew Gombolay. I also have research experiences about signal processing and data analysis when I worked with Dr. Rishikesan Kamaleswaran.
